[Trace RPK]
Add a trace marker to the RPK plot.

[Incorporate Multi-Threading]
To make best use of machines with multiple cores, the program 
should divide its tasks into separate loads for each core to handle.
The program may need to identify the number of cores a machine has
and spawn a number of threads that corresponds to the number of cores
found and available.

[Fix Loading Bug]
Random crashing when loading files into the program. Currently an unknown
as to why this is happening and where it is coming from.

[OpenGL Plots]
Employ the OpenGL based plotting system. The plots should have special
event handling for mouse and keyboard to allow the user to navigate
the plot. The camera should be centered about a certain point. Mouse
dragging should allow rotation. Scroll wheel will control zooming.
It may also be informative to display the coordinates and vector direction
of the camera at all times. Also, ticks/markers need to be calculated for
and added to the sides of the plot. The will display the measurements of
the plot. The calculation will require the distance between the camera
and the origin of the plot.
