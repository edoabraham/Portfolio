 1. Implement Projects with the Following Libraries

    Qt Framework
    QtCustomPlots
    Boost
 
// Simulation Initiator
2. Save, Open, and Run Simulation with Parameters stored in JSON format
 
3. Start Simulation from a User defined Target Directory
 
4. Create an Action Log for Detailed information about User Actions; Implement with Time Stamps
 
5. Implement On-Screen Timer for timing the simulation
 
// Plots
 
6. Parse Simulation Data Efficiently on the fly
 
7. Plot Data into 6 Different Resizable Graphs
    % Ionization vs Radius
    Temperature vs Radius
    Radius vs Time
    Density vs Radius
    Gas Distribution
    Collision Energy Distribution
 
8. Write custom conical plots for distribution graphcs
 
9. Implement the ability to save images of graphs
 
10. Implement Slider to allow the User to choose any point of the simulation to view
