Rules:
	1. File is read starting from address 0x0.
	2. Symbols and their values should be read in until 
	   all are accounted for, then the data points are read in.
	3. Symbols are delimited by '\t' (0x09), or a tab space.
	4. Symbols are followed the symbol value.
	5. Points are delimited by '\r' (0x0D), or a carriage return, 
	   and '\n' (0x0A), or newline.
	6. Important! All values (points included) are strings with variable lengths.
 
Exceptions: 
	(Example "Sampling Rate:\t10.00000\tHz\r\n")
	1. If symbol values are followed by a tab space, search
	   for another tab space or carriage return and ammend
	   all the substrings leading up to the final return.
	2. Periods (0x2E) should be treated normally, 
	   like all alphabetical characters.

File Header Symbols (in order)
(Note: All space characters listed here are present in the actual file.)
	Version:
	Maxchannels:
	Sample ID:
	Data File:
	Method:
	User Name:
	Acquisition Date and Time:
	Sampling Rate:
	Total Data Points:
	X Axis Title:
	Y Axis Title:
	X Axis Multiplier:
	Y Axis Multiplier:

Example of how the header looks:
(Note: Symbols are separated here for viewing ease. 
Escape characters were substituted for extra detail.
Symbols and values are mapped to the right.)
	"Version:\t3\r\n"									Version = 3
	"Maxchannels:\t1\r\n"									Maxchannels = 1
	"Sample ID:\ts223_1ul_full1_$A\r\n"							Sample ID = s223_1ul_full1_$A
	"Data File:\tC:\ChromQuest\Enterprise\Projects\Default\Data\06032013_s223(1).dat\r\n"	Data File = C:\ChromQuest\Enterprise\Projects\Default\Data\06032013_s223(1).dat
	"Method:\tC:\ChromQuest\Enterprise\Projects\Method\ASTM D7169.met\r\n"			Method = C:\ChromQuest\Enterprise\Projects\Method\ASTM D7169.met
	"User Name:\tSystem\r\n"								User Name = System
	"Acquisition Date and Time:\t6/3/2013 1:32:41 PM\r\n"					Acquisition Date and Time = 6/3/2013 1:32:41 PM
	"Sampling Rate:\t10.000000\tHz\r\n"							Sampling Rate = 10.000000 Hz
	"Total Data Points:\t25801\tPts.\r\n"							Total Data Points = 25801 Pts.
	"X Axis Title:\tMinutes\r\n"								X Axis Title = Minutes
	"Y Axis Title:\tMillivolts\r\n"								Y Axis Title = Millivolts
	"X Axis Multiplier:\t0.016667\r\n"							X Axis Multiplier = 0.016667
	"Y Axis Multiplier:\t0.0001\r\n"							Y Axis Multiplier = 0.0001
	
Examples of how points are formatted:
	"-238\r\n"										-238
	"-35\r\n"										-35
	...
	"108362\r\n"										108362
	"107930\r\n"										107930

Algorithms
	Parsing
		1. Symbols should be read in order, making sure to check for 
		   delimiter types when reading for symbol values.
		2. The value for "Total Data Points:" should be stored locally.
		   All values should also be stored in a specially created structure.
		3. Create a countainer with a size matching the total data points. 
		   Type should be signed int or signed long; there are no decimal values.
		3. Iterate to the end of the document, or until the total is met,
		   storing all values into the instantiated container.
		4. Method should return a value depending on the success, or failure,
		   of the parse and the integrity of the file.
		   
		   
Additional Notes:
	It should be noted that some of the symbols that store paths store paths 
	specific to the machine that created the file.
