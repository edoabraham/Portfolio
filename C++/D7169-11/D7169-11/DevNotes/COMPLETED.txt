COMPLETED:

[Offsetting] - DONE
The next thing that the app needs to be able to do is offset selected signals.
The only viable approach right now is to only change the data that is in the
graphs as they are not restricted by the rules of the original *.dat.asc format.
(x values are assumed to always start at 0 and increment by the sampling rate.)
Saving these changes will either require truncating data or altering the original
file format to accommodate an offset value for x.

[Plot Colors] - DONE
Another option that needs to be added to signal configurations is the ability
to change a plot's color. A drop down box in the config window should display
blocks of the colors for the user to choose. In the back end, the block will
be mapped to QColor values. Possibly the best way of mergin this is to have a
int to QColor mapping, with each index displaying the QColor it is mapped to.
Selection of a block will pass an index and prompt a map lookup for its color.

[Multi-Open] - DONE
Allow file open dialog to open multiple files at once. The files will each be
handled individually like normal.

[Fixed Viewport] - DONE
Left-clicking and moving should not move the view port. The view port will be fixed to
zero to the maximums on both axis.

[Shift Graph] - DONE
Ctrl+Left-clicking a signal and moving the mouse should shift a signal by a constant
value.

[Selection Zoom] - DONE
Left-clicking and dragging over a certain area will zoom the viewport to that spot.
There should be a button that resets the viewport to its original state.
Right-clicking resets the viewport.

[Time Units Correction] - DONE
Frequence to minutes. 1 / f * X Axis Multiplier.

[Y Axis Units] - DONE
Units are currently too large. Y Axis Multiplier must be factored in when storing the data.

[Swap Controls] - DONE
Zoom <-> Moving

[Different Color on Signal Load] - DONE
Preset list of colors to cycle through.

[Visualize Signal Selection] - DONE
Bolden the area around the plot. Use ItemSelectable.

[Scale Amplitude] - DONE
Left clicking to select a signal and scrolling will increase the actual amplitude (y values)
of a signal. This only applies to the selected signal.

[Qt Static Lib] - DONE
Rebuild Qt to be a static library.

[CDF Writing] - DONE
Along side the reader, if necessary for resaving, a writer needs to be implemented
as well. It is possible to implement this in the reader class and rename the original
class, or create a parallel class that can take the reader as a parameter. The first,
though, seems to be the most practical approach.

[Update VS] - DONE
Update Visual Studio to Service Pack 2012.

[Fix Qt Name] - DONE
Make sure the naming of Qt is the same in the Add-in on multiple machines.
Named changed to Qt 4.8.4 Visual Studio x86 Static Library.

[Data Truncation] - DONE
Values of -x should be truncated.

[Fix Signal Removal] - DONE
The mapping of the removal is currently incorrect. Make sure to adjust it so that
it works as intended. 
Update: As suspected, the migration back to 4.8.4 has lent itself to a minor problem.
The implementation of the QString class is slightly different in that the return of
.toStdString() has some unknown differences when compared to the original C-String
that was passed. It is possible there are different escape characters in the string
that have been added.

[Backup by TimeStamp] - DONE
Perform backup and stamp the time at the end of the file.
Also, save the backups in a "Backup" folder.

[Color Code List] - DONE
Add colors to the items in the signal list to indicate which plot they belong to.
Items should now be added with an extra column in each. Only the text color of the
first column should be changed to match that of the plot. Use the mapping of plot
data to obtain the color. Also remember to change the color when the config for
each signal is updated.

[Add Filename Column] - DONE
Add a new column in the signal listings that show the file names each signal was
loaded with. Make sure to map them with the signal names.

[Change Keys to Filenames] - DONE
Change the hash table keys to be the file names instead of the signal names.

[Change Color Order] - DONE
First four colors should be Red, Blue, Green, and Black.

[Remember Directory] - DONE
Remember the last opened directory. Save it to the registry as well.

[Multiselect Remove] - DONE
Allow the removal of multiple files.

[Fix Graph Bounds] - DONE
The top and right margins should be ignored for the selection zoom.

[Arrow Keys to Move Graph] - DONE
Allow the use of arrow keys to move signals. Use the pixelToCoord() conversion to
shift the plot a certain number of coordinates. Have settings in the preference
window.
