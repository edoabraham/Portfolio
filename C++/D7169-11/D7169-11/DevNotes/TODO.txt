TODO:

[Subtraction]
Selecting a signal and pressing Ctrl and pressing a blank will result in subtraction.
The original two signals will no longer be displayed but will still reside in memory.
Undoing the action will allow them to appear again whilst deleting the difference.

[Add Legend]
Add a legend to distinguish different signals.

[Integration]
Selecting a signal and clicking "Integrate" will calculate the integral of that signal.
Note: Read carbon table.

[Export]
The ability to save the work environment so that it can be reloaded later. This should
include all signals, tables, integrals, and other results. The implementation should
incorporate a polymorphic hierarchy with a static mother container.

[Saving]
Saving individual signals should be possible. 

[Boldface Bug]
Bug where deselecting the boldface option does not return all plots to regular font.
