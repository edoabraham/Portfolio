TODO:

[Subtraction]
Selecting a signal and pressing Ctrl and pressing a blank will result in subtraction.
The original two signals will no longer be displayed but will still reside in memory.
Undoing the action will allow them to appear again whilst deleting the difference.

[Add Legend]
Add a legend to distinguish different signals.

[Integration]
Selecting a signal and clicking "Integrate" will calculate the integral of that signal.
Note: Read carbon table.

[Export]
The ability to save the work environment so that it can be reloaded later. This should
include all signals, tables, integrals, and other results. The implementation should
incorporate a polymorphic hierarchy with a static mother container.

[Saving]
Saving individual signals should be possible. 

[Status Bar]
Label bar at the bottom that displays events that are happening in the app.

[Disable Bold]
Allow the option to disable boldfacing in a new preference box. Preference settings will
save to registry.

[Scroll Bar on Zoom]
Add a when zoomed in on a selection. Both axis. Calculate a temporal max and min for
each axis that is scaled by the pixelToCoord() method. Make a method in the main
form that will increment or decrement the viewport's lower and upper ranges. Call
a replot() after each increment or decrement. The implementation of the calculations
for the scroll should be in QCustomPlotEX.

[Add Registry Entry]
Add registry entry for system configurations for the app. The configurations should
include the last window size used and the various small tweaks like turning bold
on or off. Use platform independent QSettings to achieve this.

[Add Recent List]
Add a listing of recent files that were opened. Save this information to the system
registry.

[Undo Commands]
Add the ability to undo a command or action by a user.
