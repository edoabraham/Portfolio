[ Change Log ]

Character Rotation :
	Character rotation only occurs when movement is procured through mouse clicking. 
	Otherwise, the character will not attempt to face the mouse.

Added Target Location Threshold :
	Created a acceptable Treshold that ensures the character will stop moving, or 
	rather stop playing the animation, when it reaches an acceptable area about
	the targeted location. This way the character will not overshoot the targeted
	area and will make a complete stop.

Camera Tweaking :
	Camera now centers properly about the player's character. This is done by allowing
	the Camera to create and manage it's own target GameObject. The object then is
	synced with the player's character's position. Also, the camera can do a test
	for it's expected location using Raycasting to ensure the transformation of the
	camera is correct.
	Rotation of the camera now follows Lerp. Pitching as well as zooming are now possible.
	Also, a height offset is applied to target position in order to center the camera
	about the upper body of the character.

Walking Animations :
	Walking animations now sync up to walking/running speeds of characters. This will
	allow for animations to look more realistic (no sliding) as a character's movement
	speed varies. This means buffs, debuffs, stat changes will all have direct influence
	on the animation speed of running/walking animations.

Movement Control Registration :
	Corrected the Control System to register target positions for movement only when
	the mouse is clicked. The character will also continue to move on its own until
	it reaches its destination. Holding down the mouse button will still all the 
	player to constantly update and manuever the character.

[ Todo ]

Sync Actions :
	Actions and attacks need to syncronized so that they start, play through, end,
	and inform the system to continue onto another state. Actions should also be
	capable of being interrupted as well.
