[Architecture] Artemis Framework
Artemis is an Entity Component System that is a Component focused approach to the traditional design
as well as traditional programming designs. This approach involves all data to be packaged into
components. This components are solely influenced by systems that involve them. Entities are merely
labels, or lists, of these aggregated components.
Artemis allows you to edit components, like physics, to be edited without having to go through each
entity. It also allows for easy attach and detaching from entities.

[Programming]
Attacks are Entities with their own Element
Skills are Entities with their own Element
Characters are Entities with their own Element


[Design] Mana and Stamina Depletion Logic
Mana and Stamina do not prevent a player from using certain spells. Instead, they serve to "power"
spells. If the amount of Mana or Stamina of a skill is insufficient, the skill will cast with the
remainder of the Mana or Stamina the player has left, and adjust the power level or effects of the
ability; Abilities will be scaled down.

Conversely (OPTIONAL), the player has the ability to overpower a certain ability at the expense of
more Mana or Stamina
