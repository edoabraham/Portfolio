[ Artemis Dev Notes ]

This is a rewrite of the original C# port written for .NET 4.0.

Todo:
Investigate a new way to support higher than 64 types of components.
Possibly replace BigInteger (Int64) with BitArray.


Changes:
Updated to support 64 component types (how it was meant to be, originally).

Draw Type is removed since everything is updated via UnityEngine's Update() and LateUpdate() methods.
